    <p><b> Conclusion:- </b>
    <br>
    As we can see that next month default prediction is dependent on repayment status of past six months of all the features given to us. But there is multicollinearity between the Repayment Status features.
    <br>
    We will first train model wil all the features and try reducing the non-important features.
