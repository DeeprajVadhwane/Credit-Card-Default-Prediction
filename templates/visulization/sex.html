    <p><b> Conclusion:- </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    60% Credit Card Holders are Male & 40% Credit Card Holders are Female .
    <br>
    Female Defaulters are marginally high as compares to male .
    <br>
    It can be seen that females of age group 20-30 have very high tendency to default payment compared to males in all age brackets. 
    <br>
    Hence we can keep the SEX column of clients to predict probability of defaulting payment.
